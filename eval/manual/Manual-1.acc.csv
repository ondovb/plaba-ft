Q34_A5,6,"The literature also supports that patients with FND exhibit heightened amygdalar and periaqueductal gray reactivity to emotionally valenced stimuli, enhanced coupling between amygdalar and motor control areas, and increased amygdalar volumes.",The studies also highlighted that patients with FND showed the following symptoms: (1) increased reactivity in the brain (specifically the amygdala and periaqueductal gray) to emotional stimuli; (2) joint coordination between amygdalar (related to the amygdala) and motor control areas; and (3) increased size of the amygdala.,1,1
Q34_A5,7,"The structural neuroimaging literature also implicates cingulo-insular areas in the pathophysiology of FND, though these findings require replication and clarification.","The studies also suggest that changes in a specific central region of the brain can partly explain the unusual functional changes in the body that result from FND. However, more research is needed.",1,1
Q34_A5,8,"While more research is needed to fully elucidate the pathophysiology of FND, salience network alterations appear present in some FND populations and can be contextualized using biopsychosocial models for FND.","While more research is needed to fully understand the unusual functional changes in the body that result from FND, individuals with FND showed changes in the functioning of the brain structures involved in the process of emotions. These findings can be further investigated by applying biopsychosocial (biological, psychological and social factors) models for FND.",1,1
Q35_A8,1,Background: It is critical to developing an accurate method for differentiating between malignant and benign solitary pulmonary nodules.,It is important to create an accurate way for understanding which lung growths are cancerous and which are not.,1,1
Q35_A8,3,"Methods: The authors retrospectively analysed the clinical and computed tomography (CT) data of 121 patients with lung nodules, submitted to percutaneous CT-guided transthoracic biopsy, between 2014 and 2015.",The authors looked at clinical data and x-rays of 121 patients with lung growths between 2014 and 2015.,1,1
Q35_A8,6,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified six independent predictors of malignancy: age, gender, smoking status, current extra-pulmonary cancer, air bronchogram and nodule size (p<0.05).","Statistical analysis found six risk factors for cancerous lung growths: age, gender, smoking status, current non-lung cancer, airways appearing distinct in x-rays, and lung growth size.",1,1
Q36_A4,6,"Results: We find little evidence to support sugar addiction in humans, and findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviours, such as bingeing, occur only in the context of intermittent access to sugar.","We did not find many studies showing sugar addiction in humans, and animal studies showed addiction-like behaviors, such as bingeing, happen only when sugar is given and taken away.",1,1
Q36_A4,7,"These behaviours likely arise from intermittent access to sweet tasting or highly palatable foods, not the neurochemical effects of sugar.","Occasional access to sweet tasting or tasty foods, not the brain chemistry effects of sugar, likely cause these behaviors.",1,1
Q36_A4,8,"Conclusion: Given the lack of evidence supporting it, we argue against a premature incorporation of sugar addiction into the scientific literature and public policy recommendations.",We conclude that sugar addiction should not be part of the state of the science and public policy recommendations due to a lack of information.,1,1
Q37_A2,2,"Some vaccines, such as that for polio, are believed to produce lifelong immunity.","Some vaccines, such as those for polio, are thought to create lifelong immunity.",1,1
Q37_A2,5,"Inoculation is not without risk, particularly in immunosuppressed, allergic, febrile, or pregnant patients.","Vaccination is not without risk, particularly in those who have weakened immune systems, allergies, fevers, or who are pregnant.",1,1
Q37_A2,6,"However, in otherwise healthy patients, serious sequelae are so rare that they are far overshadowed by the enormous benefits of immunization.","In otherwise healthy patients, serious undesired health outcomes from vaccination are so rare that they are overshadowed by the huge benefits of immunization.",1,1
Q38_A10,1,Multiple myeloma is an incurable haematological cancer.,Multiple myeloma is an incurable hematological (blood) cancer.,1,1
Q38_A10,2,The increase in targeted therapies has improved the number of myeloma patients achieving a complete response and improved progression-free survival following therapy.,The increase in specified therapies has improved the number of myeloma patients achieving a complete response and improved progression-free survival after therapy.,1,1
Q38_A10,3,"However, a low level of disease or minimal residual disease (MRD) still persists which contributes to the inevitable relapse in myeloma patients.","However, a low disease level or minimal residual disease (MRD), amount of cancer cells left in the body, still occurs and contributes to relapse in myeloma patients.",1,1
Q39_A8,1,"Breastfed infants have a growth pattern that is different from formula-fed infants, which is regarded as the optimal growth pattern.",Breastfed infants have a growth pattern that is different from formula-fed infants. Growth patterns of formula-fed infants are preferred.,1,1
Q39_A8,2,"Breastfed infants increase more in weight, length, and BMI during the first 2-3 months of life and then have a slower growth velocity up to 12 months.","Breastfed infants increase more in weight, length, and BMI during the first 2-3 months of life and then slow in growth up to 12 months.",1,1
Q39_A8,8,"Recent studies have found associations between breast milk composition (total fat, protein, human milk oligosaccharides, adiponectin, leptin, and insulin) and growth.","Recent studies have found links between breast milk composition (e.g. fat, protein) and growth.",1,1
Q40_A1,2,Laxatives are the most common strategy for managing constipation.,Laxatives are the most common way to manage constipation.,1,1
Q40_A1,8,"Since that time, studies have demonstrated that abdominal massage can stimulate peristalsis, decrease colonic transit time, increase the frequency of bowel movements in constipated patients, and decrease the feelings of discomfort and pain that accompany it.","New studies have demonstrated that abdominal massage can stimulate peristalsis (contraction and relaxation of muscles), decrease time it takes for a bowel movement to go through the intestines, increase bowel movement frequency, and decrease discomfort and pain.",1,1
Q40_A1,10,"Individual case reports show that massage has been effective for patients with constipation due to a variety of diagnosed physiologic abnormalities, as well as in patients with long-term functional constipation.","Reports show that massage has been effective for patients with constipation due to a variety of bodily reasons, as well as in patients with long-term functional constipation.",1,1
