Q35_A8,6,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified six independent predictors of malignancy: age, gender, smoking status, current extra-pulmonary cancer, air bronchogram and nodule size (p<0.05).","The predictors of cancer were age, gender, smoking, having other cancers, bronchi filled with air, and nodule size.",1,1
Q36_A4,6,"Results: We find little evidence to support sugar addiction in humans, and findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviours, such as bingeing, occur only in the context of intermittent access to sugar.","Little evidence supports sugar addiction in humans. Findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviors, such as bingeing, happen only if access to sugar is irregular.",1,1

Q38_A10,2,The increase in targeted therapies has improved the number of myeloma patients achieving a complete response and improved progression-free survival following therapy.,New treatments have improved the number of myeloma patients with a complete response and progression-free survival.,0,1
Q38_A10,3,"However, a low level of disease or minimal residual disease (MRD) still persists which contributes to the inevitable relapse in myeloma patients.","Low levels of disease or minimal residual disease (MRD) still exist, which contributes to the relapse (disease returning or stopping responding to treatments) in myeloma patients.",1,1
Q39_A8,1,"Breastfed infants have a growth pattern that is different from formula-fed infants, which is regarded as the optimal growth pattern.","Breastfed infants have a growth pattern that is different from formula-fed infants, which is considered as the optimal growth pattern.",1,1
Q39_A8,2,"Breastfed infants increase more in weight, length, and BMI during the first 2-3 months of life and then have a slower growth velocity up to 12 months.","Breastfed infants increase more in weight, length, and body mass index (BMI) during the first 2-3 months of life and then have a slower growth up to 12 months.",1,1
Q39_A8,8,"Recent studies have found associations between breast milk composition (total fat, protein, human milk oligosaccharides, adiponectin, leptin, and insulin) and growth.","Breast milk composition (total fat, protein, sugars and other chemicals) is related to growth.",0,1

Q40_A1,10,"Individual case reports show that massage has been effective for patients with constipation due to a variety of diagnosed physiologic abnormalities, as well as in patients with long-term functional constipation.",Individuals have had relief from constipation due to many different causes.
