Q34_A5,6,"The literature also supports that patients with FND exhibit heightened amygdalar and periaqueductal gray reactivity to emotionally valenced stimuli, enhanced coupling between amygdalar and motor control areas, and increased amygdalar volumes.","FND patients show increased amygdalar volume, reactivity, and connectivity to other brain areas. The amygdala is a brain area heavily involved in emotional processing.",1,1
Q34_A5,7,"The structural neuroimaging literature also implicates cingulo-insular areas in the pathophysiology of FND, though these findings require replication and clarification.","The studies imply cingulo-insular areas are involved in FND's disease biology. However, these findings need replication and explanation.",1,1
Q34_A5,8,"While more research is needed to fully elucidate the pathophysiology of FND, salience network alterations appear present in some FND populations and can be contextualized using biopsychosocial models for FND.","While we need more research to explain the biology of FND, salience network changes are present in some FND groups and can be described with biological, psychological, and social FND models.",1,1
Q35_A8,1,Background: It is critical to developing an accurate method for differentiating between malignant and benign solitary pulmonary nodules.,"For background, accurately identifying between malignant (harmful) and benign (harmless) solitary pulmonary nodules (single growths in the lung) is important.",1,1

Q35_A8,6,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified six independent predictors of malignancy: age, gender, smoking status, current extra-pulmonary cancer, air bronchogram and nodule size (p<0.05).","We found six independent predictors of malignancy: age, gender, smoking status, current extra-pulmonary cancer (cancer from outside the lungs), air bronchogram (air-filled parts of the lung when the background is airless) and nodule size.",1,1
Q36_A4,6,"Results: We find little evidence to support sugar addiction in humans, and findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviours, such as bingeing, occur only in the context of intermittent access to sugar.","For results, we find little evidence supporting sugar addiction in humans. Animal findings suggest that addiction-like behaviours, such as bingeing (excess eating), occur only with irregular access to sugar.",1,1
Q36_A4,7,"These behaviours likely arise from intermittent access to sweet tasting or highly palatable foods, not the neurochemical effects of sugar.","These behaviours likely came from irregular access to sweet tasting or highly palatable foods, not the brain effects of sugar.",1,1
Q36_A4,8,"Conclusion: Given the lack of evidence supporting it, we argue against a premature incorporation of sugar addiction into the scientific literature and public policy recommendations.","In conclusion, due to lack of evidence, we argue against the idea of sugar addiction for scientific study and public policy recommendations.",1,1
Q37_A2,2,"Some vaccines, such as that for polio, are believed to produce lifelong immunity.","Certain vaccines, like the one for polio, are believed to provide protection for a person's entire life.",1,1
Q37_A2,5,"Inoculation is not without risk, particularly in immunosuppressed, allergic, febrile, or pregnant patients.","Vaccines can be risky, especially for people who have weakened immune systems, allergies, high fevers, or are pregnant.",1,1
Q37_A2,6,"However, in otherwise healthy patients, serious sequelae are so rare that they are far overshadowed by the enormous benefits of immunization.","In people who are generally healthy, bad side effects from vaccines are extremely uncommon and not as important as the many good things that vaccines do to help prevent illnesses.",1,1
Q38_A10,1,Multiple myeloma is an incurable haematological cancer.,Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that cannot be cured.,1,1
Q38_A10,2,The increase in targeted therapies has improved the number of myeloma patients achieving a complete response and improved progression-free survival following therapy.,The use of specific treatments has helped more multiple myeloma patients to recover fully and have a longer time without the disease getting worse.,1,1
Q38_A10,3,"However, a low level of disease or minimal residual disease (MRD) still persists which contributes to the inevitable relapse in myeloma patients.","In some cases, even though treatments have improved, a small amount of cancer cells may still be left in the body, called minimal residual disease (MRD). This can increase the chances of the cancer coming back in patients with myeloma.",1,1
Q39_A8,1,"Breastfed infants have a growth pattern that is different from formula-fed infants, which is regarded as the optimal growth pattern.",Formula-fed infants have a preferred growth pattern compared to breastfed infants. Breastfed infants have a different growth pattern.,1,1
Q39_A8,2,"Breastfed infants increase more in weight, length, and BMI during the first 2-3 months of life and then have a slower growth velocity up to 12 months.","Breastfed babies grow more rapidly in weight, length, and BMI during their first 2-3 months of life but then experience slower growth up to the age of 12 months.",1,1
Q39_A8,8,"Recent studies have found associations between breast milk composition (total fat, protein, human milk oligosaccharides, adiponectin, leptin, and insulin) and growth.","New studies have discovered connections between breast milk ingredients, such as fat and protein, and an infant's growth.",1,1
Q40_A1,2,Laxatives are the most common strategy for managing constipation.,The usual way to treat constipation is by using laxatives.,1,1
Q40_A1,8,"Since that time, studies have demonstrated that abdominal massage can stimulate peristalsis, decrease colonic transit time, increase the frequency of bowel movements in constipated patients, and decrease the feelings of discomfort and pain that accompany it.","New research shows that abdominal massage can help your muscles move better, make bowel movements happen faster, and make them happen more often. It can also reduce pain and discomfort.",1,1
Q40_A1,10,"Individual case reports show that massage has been effective for patients with constipation due to a variety of diagnosed physiologic abnormalities, as well as in patients with long-term functional constipation.","Records show that massage has helped people with constipation for many different reasons, as well as those who have had it for a long time and don't know why.",1,1
