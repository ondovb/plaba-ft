Q1_A4,1,Purpose: To determine predictors of best-corrected postoperative visual acuity (VA) in patients who underwent surgical intervention for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.,This study aimed to find what predicts how well the vision will recover after surgery to repair common retinal detachment (the damage to light-sensitive layer  at the back of the eye (retina) when it is pulled away from its normal position.),1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,2,Materials and methods: Primary macula-off retinal detachments from the University of Colorado Primary Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Database (2012-2017) were reviewed.,Cases of retinal detachment repaired at from the University of Colorado in 2012-2017 were studied.,1,1,1,0
Q1_A4,3,The primary outcome measure was a postoperative VA of 20/40 or better at least 6 months after surgery.,Success was defined as vision restored to slightly nearsighted  or better at least 6 months after surgery.,1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,4,"Patient demographics, medical history, duration of central vision loss before surgery, examination findings, operative technique, and postoperative findings were analyzed as possible predictors of postoperative visual recovery to 20/40 or better.","Things that could effect vision recovery to slightly nearsightedl or better included: patients' distinct characteristics, such as age; their health condition; how long their vision was reduced before surgery, the type of surgery; and the physical examination of the eye before and after surgery.",1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,6,A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for variables that were significant in the univariable analyses.,The conditions that appeared related to vision were studied in-depth.,1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,8,Results: One hundred thirty-one patients met inclusion criteria.,One hundred thirty-one patients were included in the study.,1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,9,Eighty-one (61.8%) patients achieved a postoperative VA of 20/40 or better 6 or more months after surgery.,Eighty-one of these patients were slightly nearsightedl or had better vision 6 or more months after surgery.,1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,10,"Patients with a single retinal break were more likely than patients with more than one break to reach a postoperative VA of 20/40 or better (76.9% vs. 55.4%, p = 0.021).",Chances to be slightly nearsighted or have better vision after surgery were higher if the patient had only one break in the retina.,1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,11,Patients with a better preoperative logMAR VA had better postoperative VA (p = 0.021).,Patients whose vision was better before surgery had better vision after surgery.,1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,12,Duration of central vision loss prior to surgical repair was not related to final postoperative VA in this particular study.,How long the clear vision was disturbed before surgery did not affect vision after surgery.,1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,13,Conclusion: Postoperative recovery of visual acuity to 20/40 or better was significantly more common in patients with a single retinal break as well as in patients with better preoperative visual acuity.,Patients with a single break in their retina and better vision before surgery had a much better vision recovery to slightly nearsighted or better after the surgery.,1,1,1,1
Q1_A4,14,Duration of central vision loss prior to surgical repair was not significantly associated with postoperative VA.,How long the patients had reduced vision before surgery did not affect vision after surgery.,1,1,1,1
Q2_A6,1,Background: Our primary objective was to determine the rate of persistent Trichomonas infection among pregnant women posttreatment.,This study aimed to find out how many pregnant women stay infected with trichomonas (a parasite that causes a sexually transmitted disease) after treatment.,1,1,1,1
Q2_A6,2,The secondary objective was to determine if oral multidose metronidazole was associated with fewer cases of persistent Trichomonas compared with single-dose treatment.,"The study also compared if multiple doses of metronidazole, a drug that treats trichomoniasis, are better than a single dose at curing the infection.",1,1,1,1
Q2_A6,3,Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed with genital Trichomonas vaginalis from 2008 to 2017.,The study included women diagnosed with Trichomonas vaginalis from 2008 to 2017.,1,1,1,1
Q2_A6,4,We calculated the rate of persistent Trichomonas by dividing the number of positive Trichomonas tests collected 21 days or longer posttreatment by the total number of women treated and retested.,The doctors studied how many women out of those who had tests 21 days or longer after treatment still had the infection.,1,1,1,1
Q2_A6,5,Bivariate analysis was performed to compare the rates of positive tests after single and multidose metronidazole.,The stud compared the tests showing the infection in women who took a single dose to those who had multiple doses of metronidazole -- the drug that treats trichomoniasis.,1,1,1,0
Q2_A6,6,Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with persistent infection.,The doctors also studied what is associated with lasting infection.,1,1,1,1
Q2_A6,7,Results: Five hundred forty-two women with 565 pregnancies were diagnosed with Trichomonas infection.,542 women with 565 pregnancies had trichomoniasis.,1,1,1,1

Q2_A6,9,Posttreatment Trichomonas tests were collected 21 days or longer in 326 subjects and 44% (143) were positive.,21 days after treatment or longer the test showed infection in 143 out of 326 women (slightly less than half).,1,1,1,1
Q2_A6,10,"Rates of positive Trichomonas tests among women receiving single-dose and multidose regimens were similar (45% vs. 40%, P = 0.50).",There was now difference in lasting infection after the two different treatments.,1,1,1,0
Q2_A6,11,"Women who had â‰¥1 pregnancy affected by Trichomonas infection were more likely to have a positive test posttreatment (adjusted odds ratio, 20.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-215.3).",Tests showing the infection were more likely in women who had one or more pregnancies during the infection.,1,1,1,1

Q2_A6,13,"Conclusions: Given high rates of positive Trichomonas tests and increased detection with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), all pregnant women should be retested with NAATs approximately 3 weeks posttreatment.","Because the infection rates are high, all pregnant women should have repeat tests for trichomoniasis approximately 3 weeks after treatment.",1,1,1,1

Q3_A10,9,"Similar, but more pronounced changes were also observed versus EE/DRSP, which supports the hypothesis that the effect of COCs on hemostasis parameters is mainly mediated by the estrogenic component.","Similar, but larger changes were seen for E4/DRSP compared to EE/DRSP, which indicates that the pills effect the  blood clotting substances mainly due to the estrogen part.",1,1,1,1
Q3_A10,10,Further studies are needed to provide more insight into the venous thromboembolic risk of E4/DRSP.,More studies are needed to see the risks of E4/DRSP for venous thromboembolism -- blood clotting  in the veins.,1,1,1,1
