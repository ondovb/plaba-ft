Q34_A5,6,"The literature also supports that patients with FND exhibit heightened amygdalar and periaqueductal gray reactivity to emotionally valenced stimuli, enhanced coupling between amygdalar and motor control areas, and increased amygdalar volumes.",,-1,-1
Q34_A5,7,"The structural neuroimaging literature also implicates cingulo-insular areas in the pathophysiology of FND, though these findings require replication and clarification.","Static brain imaging research also suggests the connection between the MCC and insula has a role in FND. However, these findings need to be reproduced and clarified.",1,1
Q34_A5,8,"While more research is needed to fully elucidate the pathophysiology of FND, salience network alterations appear present in some FND populations and can be contextualized using biopsychosocial models for FND.","More research is needed to completely explain how FND works. However, it seems that changes in the connections among the MCC and related brain regions appear in some people with FND. The importance of these changes can be learned by thinking about FND in terms of the impact of brain regions on mental and social functions.",1,1
Q35_A8,1,Background: It is critical to developing an accurate method for differentiating between malignant and benign solitary pulmonary nodules.,It is very important to create an accurate way to tell if single lung nodes are cancer.,1,1
Q35_A8,3,"Methods: The authors retrospectively analysed the clinical and computed tomography (CT) data of 121 patients with lung nodules, submitted to percutaneous CT-guided transthoracic biopsy, between 2014 and 2015.",We looked back at medical records and CT scans of 121 patients with lung nodes. These were patients that went on to have a needle biopsy guided into the chest by CT scan. We looked at patients between 2014 and 2015.,1,1
Q35_A8,6,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified six independent predictors of malignancy: age, gender, smoking status, current extra-pulmonary cancer, air bronchogram and nodule size (p<0.05).","The statistics found six things that each predicted cancer on their own. These included age, gender, smoking, other non-lung cancer, and node size. The last was visible airway branches on the scan, which means the surrounding air sacs are filled with fluid.",1,1
Q36_A4,6,"Results: We find little evidence to support sugar addiction in humans, and findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviours, such as bingeing, occur only in the context of intermittent access to sugar.","We didn’t find much evidence of sugar addiction in humans. Results from the animal studies suggests that addiction-like behaviors, like bingeing, only happen for on-and-off access to sugar.",1,1
Q36_A4,7,"These behaviours likely arise from intermittent access to sweet tasting or highly palatable foods, not the neurochemical effects of sugar.","These behaviors likely come from occasional access to sweet or very tasty foods. That is, it’s not the chemical effects of sugar on the brain.",1,1
Q36_A4,8,"Conclusion: Given the lack of evidence supporting it, we argue against a premature incorporation of sugar addiction into the scientific literature and public policy recommendations.",We argue against adding sugar addiction to the scientific literature and public policy recommendations. This would be premature. There is just not enough evidence supporting it.,1,1
Q37_A2,2,"Some vaccines, such as that for polio, are believed to produce lifelong immunity.",We think some vaccines make you immune for life. The polio vaccine is one example.,1,1
Q37_A2,5,"Inoculation is not without risk, particularly in immunosuppressed, allergic, febrile, or pregnant patients.","Vaccines do have risks. This is especially true for people that are allergic, feverish, pregnant, or have weakened immune systems.",1,1
Q37_A2,6,"However, in otherwise healthy patients, serious sequelae are so rare that they are far overshadowed by the enormous benefits of immunization.","However, serious side effects are rare in people that are healthy otherwise. So rare, in fact, that the huge benefits of vaccines far outweigh them.",1,1
Q38_A10,1,Multiple myeloma is an incurable haematological cancer.,Multiple myeloma (MM) is a blood cancer. There is no cure.,1,1
Q38_A10,2,The increase in targeted therapies has improved the number of myeloma patients achieving a complete response and improved progression-free survival following therapy.,More treatments specifically for MM have meant more patients with no trace of cancer left. Patients also have more time without the cancer getting worse.,1,1
Q38_A10,3,"However, a low level of disease or minimal residual disease (MRD) still persists which contributes to the inevitable relapse in myeloma patients.","Still, a small amount of cancer sticks around. This means sooner or later, MM comes back.",1,1
Q39_A8,1,"Breastfed infants have a growth pattern that is different from formula-fed infants, which is regarded as the optimal growth pattern.",The growth pattern of breastfed infants is different from formula-fed infants. This is thought of as the best growth pattern.,1,1
Q39_A8,2,"Breastfed infants increase more in weight, length, and BMI during the first 2-3 months of life and then have a slower growth velocity up to 12 months.","Breastfed infants grow more in weight, length, and BMI in the first 2 to 3 months. Then they grow more slowly up to 12 months.",1,1
Q39_A8,8,"Recent studies have found associations between breast milk composition (total fat, protein, human milk oligosaccharides, adiponectin, leptin, and insulin) and growth.","Recent studies have found links between breast milk makeup and growth. This includes levels of total fat, protein, complex sugars, and hormones.",1,1
Q40_A1,2,Laxatives are the most common strategy for managing constipation.,Laxatives are the most common treatment for constipation.,1,1
Q40_A1,8,"Since that time, studies have demonstrated that abdominal massage can stimulate peristalsis, decrease colonic transit time, increase the frequency of bowel movements in constipated patients, and decrease the feelings of discomfort and pain that accompany it.","Since then, studies have shown that belly massage can jumpstart digestion in constipated patients. It can also make stool move through the colon faster and make bowel movements happen more often. Finally, the studies show that belly massage can lessen the discomfort and pain that come with constipation.",1,1
Q40_A1,10,"Individual case reports show that massage has been effective for patients with constipation due to a variety of diagnosed physiologic abnormalities, as well as in patients with long-term functional constipation.",Individual cases show that massage works for patients with constipation from several known causes. They also show it works in patients with long-term constipation arising on its own.,1,1
