Q32_A2,7,The effects of IEDs during encoding and recall were stronger in the left hemisphere than in the right (p < 0.05).,The impact of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on memory was more pronounced in the left side of the brain compared to the right side.,1,1
Q32_A2,8,"Of six brain areas analyzed, IEDs in the inferior-temporal, medial-temporal, and parietal areas significantly affected memory (false discovery rate < 0.05).","Out of the six areas of the brain that we looked at, we found that abnormal brain activity (interictal epileptiform discharges or IEDs) in the inferior-temporal, medial-temporal, and parietal areas had a significant impact on memory.",1,1
Q32_A2,9,Significance: These findings reveal a network of brain areas sensitive to IEDs with key nodes in temporal as well as parietal lobes.,"Overall, this study helps us understand that there are specific parts of the brain that are affected by abnormal brain activity (interictal epileptiform discharges or IEDs) and that these areas play a crucial role in memory. Specifically, we found that the temporal and parietal lobes are particularly important in this network of brain areas.",1,1

Q34_A5,6,"The literature also supports that patients with FND exhibit heightened amygdalar and periaqueductal gray reactivity to emotionally valenced stimuli, enhanced coupling between amygdalar and motor control areas, and increased amygdalar volumes.","Research also suggests that patients with FND have increased activity in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray areas of the brain when they are exposed to emotionally charged information. They also have stronger connections between the amygdala and areas of the brain responsible for motor control, and their amygdala is larger in size compared to individuals without FND.",1,1
Q34_A5,7,"The structural neuroimaging literature also implicates cingulo-insular areas in the pathophysiology of FND, though these findings require replication and clarification.","The research on brain structure in patients with FND suggests that the cingulo-insular areas may play a role in the development of the condition, but more studies are needed to confirm and clarify these findings.",1,1
Q34_A5,8,"While more research is needed to fully elucidate the pathophysiology of FND, salience network alterations appear present in some FND populations and can be contextualized using biopsychosocial models for FND.","While there is still more research to be done to fully understand the causes of FND, changes in the salience network of the brain have been found in some patients with FND. These findings can be better understood by considering the biopsychosocial models of FND.",1,1

Q35_A8,6,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified six independent predictors of malignancy: age, gender, smoking status, current extra-pulmonary cancer, air bronchogram and nodule size (p<0.05).","Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that there were six factors that could independently predict whether a nodule was cancerous or not: age, gender, smoking status, having another type of cancer, air bronchogram, and the size of the nodule.",1,1
Q36_A4,6,"Results: We find little evidence to support sugar addiction in humans, and findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviours, such as bingeing, occur only in the context of intermittent access to sugar.","Our findings suggest that there is limited evidence to support the idea of sugar addiction in humans. Studies on animals show that addiction-like behaviors, such as bingeing, only occur when sugar is only available intermittently.",1,1
Q36_A4,7,"These behaviours likely arise from intermittent access to sweet tasting or highly palatable foods, not the neurochemical effects of sugar.","These behaviors are most likely caused by occasional access to tasty or highly enjoyable foods, rather than the effects of sugar on the brain.",1,1
Q36_A4,8,"Conclusion: Given the lack of evidence supporting it, we argue against a premature incorporation of sugar addiction into the scientific literature and public policy recommendations.","In conclusion, we believe it's too soon to start considering sugar addiction as a real problem and making recommendations based on it. There is not enough evidence to support the idea of sugar addiction in humans.",1,1
