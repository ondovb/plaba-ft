Q24_A1,3,Strategies that inhibit IL-1 are certainly helpful in COVID-19 and can represent one of the therapeutic options.,Treatments that block IL-1 can be helpful in treating COVID-19 and may be one option for treatment.,1,0,1,1
Q24_A1,4,"However, until now, COVID-19 therapy has been scarce and, in many cases, ineffective, since there are no specific drugs other than the vaccine that can solve this serious health problem.","So far, there have been few effective treatments for COVID-19. Other than the vaccine, there are no specific drugs that can effectively treat this serious health issue.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,5,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines which are the newest approach, are already available and will certainly meet the many expectations that the population is waiting for.","The newest type of vaccine, called mRNA vaccines, are now available. They are expected to fulfill the high hopes that the population has been waiting for.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,6,"mRNA vaccines, coated with protected soft fatty lipids, use genetic mRNA (plus various inactive excipients) to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein, which will instruct the immune system to produce specific antibodies.","mRNA vaccines use genetic material to create a piece of the coronavirus spike protein, which helps the immune system create antibodies. The vaccine is coated in a protective layer to make it safe and effective.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,7,The soft fatty lipids allow the entry of mRNA into cells where it is absorbed into the cytoplasm and initiates the synthesis of the spike protein.,"The protective coating on the vaccine helps it enter cells, where the genetic material is absorbed and prompts the production of the spike protein.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,8,"In addition, vaccination also activates T cells that help the immune system respond to further exposure to the coronavirus.","Vaccination also helps activate T cells, which can help the immune system fight off the coronavirus if you come into contact with it again.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,9,mRNA induces the synthesis of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus which stimulate the antibody response of the vaccinated person with the production of neutralizing antibodies.,The mRNA in the vaccine stimulates the immune system to make proteins that look like parts of the coronavirus. This helps the vaccinated person's body create antibodies that can neutralize the virus.,1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,10,"The new variant of the coronavirus-19 has been detected in the UK where, at the moment, the London government has imposed a lockdown with restrictions on international movements.","A new version of the coronavirus, called the variant, has been found in the UK.

Q24_A1,13,"Recent studies suggest that coronavirus-19 variation occurs at the level N501Y of the spike protein and involves 23 separate mutations on the spike, 17 of which are linked to the virus proteins, thus giving specific characteristics to the virus.","Recent studies have found that the variation of the coronavirus-19 involves changes in a specific part of the spike protein called N501Y. There are 23 different mutations on the spike protein, with 17 of them affecting the virus proteins, which gives the virus its unique characteristics.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,14,"In general, coronaviruses undergo many mutations that are often not decisive for their biological behavior and does not significantly alter the structure and the components of the virus.","In general, coronaviruses go through many changes, or mutations, but these often don't have a big impact on how the virus behaves or its structure.",0,1,1,1

They want to know if the antibodies produced by the vaccine can still fight against this new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,22,This variant has a very high viral growth and is less detectable with the RT-PCR technique in the laboratory.,This variant of the virus can grow very quickly and is harder to detect in the laboratory using the RT-PCR technique.,1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,23,"It has been reported that the British variant that increases viral load does not cause more severe effects in the respiratory tract and lung disease, therefore, it is certain that the variant is growing rapidly and must be kept under control; for this reason, laboratory data is expected impatiently.","There have been reports that the British variant of the virus, which spreads quickly, does not cause more severe respiratory or lung disease. However, it is still important to keep the variant under control. We are eagerly awaiting laboratory data to learn more about it.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,24,The study on the many variants that coronavirus-19 presents is very interesting and complete and clearer data on this topic will be ready in the near future.,The research on the different variants of the coronavirus-19 is fascinating and we will have more detailed information on this topic soon.,1,1,1,1

This is something that researchers are still studying.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,26,"In order to be certain and to not have unexpected surprises, we need to reduce the spread and the transmission speed of viral variants that could appear around the world, creating new pandemics.","To make sure we're prepared and avoid any surprises, it's important to slow down the spread of viral variants that could lead to new pandemics in different parts of the world.",1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,27,"For this reason, the scientific community is on the alert since laboratory tests on serum antibodies from COVID-19 survivors have been reported to be less effective in attacking the variant.",That's why scientists are paying close attention. They've found that lab tests with antibodies from people who have survived COVID-19 are not as effective at fighting the variant of the virus.,1,1,1,1
Q24_A1,28,"In light of the above, the scientific community must be on the alert as larger variants of the spike protein could escape vaccine-induced antibodies, which for now are of great help to the community and can save millions of lives.","Based on all of this information, it's important for scientists to stay vigilant. The new variants of the virus might be able to evade the antibodies produced by the vaccine, which is currently helping many people and saving lives.",1,1,1,1

Q25_A1,2,Regular exercise has been shown to slow the progression of cardiovascular disease and to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.,Regular exercise can help slow down the development of heart disease and decrease the chances of experiencing heart-related illness or death.,1,1,1,1
Q25_A1,3,"More recently, exercise-induced increases in blood flow and shear stress have been observed to enhance vascular function and structure.","New research has found that when we exercise, our blood flow and the friction on our blood vessels increase, which helps improve how our blood vessels function and their overall structure.",1,1,1,1
Q25_A1,4,"By increasing the release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, shear stress augments endothelium-dependent vasodilation and inhibits multiple processes involved in atherogenesis and restenosis.","When we exercise, our body releases certain chemicals that help widen our blood vessels, allowing for better blood flow. This also helps prevent the buildup of fatty deposits in our arteries and the narrowing of blood vessels.",1,1,1,1
