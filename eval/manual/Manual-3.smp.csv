Q1_A4,1,Purpose: To determine predictors of best-corrected postoperative visual acuity (VA) in patients who underwent surgical intervention for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.,"The retina is the light-sensitive layer inside the eye. The central part is called the macula. If the macula comes apart from the wall of the eye, it is called macula-off retinal detachment (MORD).

Q7_A3,1,Background: To examine our initial experience in carotid stenting (CS) for the prevention of stroke in patients with high-grade carotid stenoses.,"The carotid artery supplies a lot of blood to the brain. If it becomes narrowed, it can cause strokes. One way to fix this is with a stent, a small sleeve placed in the artery to hold it open. The goal of this study was to look at our first try of stents in the carotid artery for preventing strokes in patients with severe carotid artery narrowing.",1,1,1,1
