Q36_A4,6,"Results: We find little evidence to support sugar addiction in humans, and findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviours, such as bingeing, occur only in the context of intermittent access to sugar.","We find little evidence to support sugar addiction in humans, and findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviors, such as bingeing, occur only when sugar is intermittently available.",1,1
Q36_A4,7,"These behaviours likely arise from intermittent access to sweet tasting or highly palatable foods, not the neurochemical effects of sugar.","These behaviors likely arise from intermittent access to sweet tasting or very enjoyable foods, not the brain-related effects of sugar.",1,1
